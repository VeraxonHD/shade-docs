# Welcome to Shade.

Shade, formerly Eos, is a sleek, fully configurable and fully responsive bot for Discord, written in the Discord.js Library. It features both moderation and ultility designed to improve the lives of the brave men and women who moderate Discord guilds. Shade is also fully configurable, giving server owners power over what messages, roles and channels information and messages are sent to. Logs are automatically made into easy-to-read embeds and sent to a log channel, and can be split up at a moments notice, to give you full oversight on what is going on in your guild. All commands are easy to use, intuitively laid out, and fool-proof, as well as coming with sensible permission requirements to make sure everything is secure.

Shade also comes with full, frequent support from myself, as well as extensive heavy-duty testing under the rigours of popular servers.
