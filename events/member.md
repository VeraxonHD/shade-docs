### Member logs

Member logs \(client.guildMemberAdd/client.GuildMemberRemove\) are toggleable events, grouped together.

##### memberLog actions

* display a mod-only log embed in either `joinLogChannelID` or `logChannelID`'s channels, depending on which is set.

* send a message in a channel of your choice \( `joinLogChannel` \), but this can be disabled.
