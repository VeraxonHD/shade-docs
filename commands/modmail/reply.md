### Reply

This is used to send a reply to a user. It is sent in the format

```js
`**[${dateformat(new Date(), "HH:MM:ss")}] <${message.author.tag}>** - ${message.content}`
```

Which gives something like this: **`[01:23:45] <Vex#1101> - Hello World`**

The usage is simply !r \[text\]/!reply \[text\]
