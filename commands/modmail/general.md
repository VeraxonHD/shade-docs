### ModMail - The Discord Postmaster.

ModMail is only available to members of [The Division Discord](https://discord.gg/thedivision), though this may soon change. For any of those guys reading this, ISAC is now `!` and Shade is `.`

#### How does Modmail work?

Modmail is activated by a user sending a message to Shade\#6262, which is then forwarded to the ModMail guild. After this, regular correspondence takes place through the .r/.ar commands. It can then be closed, and the correspondence will be logged.
