### Editing your config file, general information.

This is the most important part of using Shade. One false move and nothing works. However, I've tried to make the config command easy to use so you should know what you're doing.

The first step when changing your config is to find out the convars. You can do that using the next page in this category, or by typing `!!configure`, which will show a text output with your current configuration.

Next, you'll need to identify which convar you want to change. They're fairly easy to discern by themselves. After that, type `!!configure [the convar] [the new data]`, which will set the convar to that piece of data.

If you'd like, you can check that the data has changed correctly by typing `!!configure` again.

**See the next page for the list of possible convars.**
